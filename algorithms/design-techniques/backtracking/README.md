# Backtracking

It is a technique where we start with a possible solution/move and we try to solve the problem using the selected solution/move if it doesn't work we `backtrack` and select a different solution/move, we continue doing this until the problem is solved.

  <summary>Problem 1. Rat in a maze</summary>
  
  A Maze is given as `n * n` binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., `maze[0][0]` and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., `maze[n-1][n-1]`. A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down. 
  
  In the maze matrix, `0` means the block is a dead end and `1` means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
