# Greedy algorithms

It is a problem-solving technique based on choosing the best solution at the time. That is the best possible solution at each step with the hope of finding the global best solution.

  <summary>Problem 1. Min-coin change</summary>
  
  Given a value `v`, if we want to make a change for `v`, and we have an infinite supply of each of `[c1, c2, c3, ..., cn]` valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? If itâ€™s not possible to make a change, print -1.
  Example: Given the value `36` and the coins `[1, 5, 10, 25]` the result would be `3` as we can make a change with coins `[25, 10, 1]`.
