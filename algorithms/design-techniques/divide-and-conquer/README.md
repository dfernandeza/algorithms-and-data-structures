  <summary>Problem 1. Maximum subarray sum</summary>
  
  You are given a one dimensional array that may contain both positive and negative integers, find the sum of contiguous subarray of numbers which has the largest sum.
  
  For example for array `[-2, -5, 6, -2, -3, 1, 5, -6]`, the maximum subarray sum will be `7` which is the sum of the elements `6, -2, -3, 1, 5`.
