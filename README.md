# Data structures and algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms using modern JavaScript.

The intention with this repository is not to only serve as a playground to learn DSA (or as a refresher) but also to practice solving different coding problems using DSA.

## Covered data structures

- [x] Array
- [x] Linked list
- [x] Doubly-linked list
- [x] Stack
- [x] Queue
- [x] Tree
- [ ] Trie
- [x] Binary search tree
- [ ] AVL tree
- [ ] Red-Black tree
- [x] Binary heap
- [x] Graph

## Covered algorithms

### Sorting

- [x] Bubble sort
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Selection sort
- [x] Merge sort
- [x] Quick sort
- [x] Bucket sort
- [x] Counting sort
- [x] Radix sort
- [x] Cycle sort
- [x] Heap sort
- [x] Topological sort (top-sort)

### Searching

- [x] Linear search
- [x] Binary search
- [ ] Interpolation search
- [x] Breadth first search
- [x] Depth first search

### Others

Shortest path

- [x] Dijkstra's
- [ ] Floyd-Warshall
- [ ] Minimum spanning tree (MST)
- [ ] Prim's
- [ ] Kruskal's
- [ ] Bellmanâ€“Ford

## Covered algorithms designs and techniques

- [x] Divide and conquer
- [ ] Dynamic programming
- [ ] Greedy
- [ ] Backtracking

## Exploring the code

There are 2 directories `algorithms` and `data-structures` where you can find all the different implementations. Each algorithm and data structure would have a `README` file containing a small description and a list of coding problems that maps to a `*.problems.test.js` file containing the solutions.

## Running your own copy

To run your own copy, fork this repository and execute:

```
npm i
npm test
```

_This project uses [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for writing the tests and [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) as the test runner._
