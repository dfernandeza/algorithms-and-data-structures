# Data structures and algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of common data structures and algorithms using modern JavaScript.

The intention with this repository is not only to serve as a playground to learn DSA (or as a refresher) but also to practice solving different coding problems using DSA.

## Exploring the code

There are 2 directories `algorithms` and `data-structures` where you can find all the different implementations. Each algorithm and data structure would have a `README` file containing a small description and a `*.problems.test.js` file containing solutions for different coding problems that use that specific algorithm or data structure.

## Running your own copy

To run your own copy, clone this repository and execute:

```
npm i
npm test
```

_This project uses [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) for writing the tests and [SWC](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) as the test runner._
